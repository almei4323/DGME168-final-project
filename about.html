		I like travel and photography. I usually traveled internationally for eight 
		weeks straight with just my carry-on duffle bag and a small camera bag. This picture of my carry-on luggage was taken at the ShangHai Airport.
		
		Once I got somewhere I liked, I would often leave my carry-on luggage in that city and take off on a week long trip to another city, 
		town or scenic spot with just my camera bag or a cheap shoulder bag that I buy locally. 
		
		The shoulder bag in this picture was purchased in Yichang, China for the purpose of traveling around Guangxi province for a week. 
		It was only 70 yuan or about $10 U.S. money.
